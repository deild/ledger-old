A Go Programming Language lexer and parser CLI to reporting transactions from a ledger file, 
similar to the [Ledger](http://ledger-cli.org) command line tool written in C++.

**Double-entry accounting system with a command-line reporting interface.**

Ledger is a command-line accounting tool based on the power and completeness of double-entry accounting.  
It is only a reporting tool, which means it never modifies your data files,
but it does offers a large selection of reports, and different ways to customize them to your liking.
